For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Always include detailed comments in files explaining what each piece does and is for so I can learn what things do as we build.

You must record your changes into docs/CHANGELOG.md - If this doesn't exsist, please create it. 
Document all requirements I gave you into the docs folder.
Include functional/non-functional features, implementation details, and the intended user experience as well as any other details that would be helpful. 

For every project discussion, maintain and update a project-map.md file in the docs directory following this structure:
1. Create if not exists: docs/project-map.md
2. Update with any new information discussed
3. Include all technical decisions and architecture choices
4. Maintain hierarchy using markdown heading levels
5. Add <!-- markmap: fold --> comments for better visualization
6. Ensure all major components and their relationships are documented
7. Link to relevant documentation and code files when applicable

The project map should be updated with every significant change or addition to the project, ensuring it remains a living document that accurately reflects the current state of the project.
