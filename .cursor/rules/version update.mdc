when we update to a new version of the app, we want to 
    • update the app UI at the bottom where it says "v1.x.x"
    • Add a new entry to [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:docs/CHANGELOG.md) - remember we never want to rewrite or overwrite whats in here, only add to it. 
    • Make sure the [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [project-map.md](mdc:docs/project-map.md) is always up-to-date as well with any new version.
    • Update the What's New section in [src/components/Help.tsx](mdc:src/components/Help.tsx) to show the latest version and its changes.
